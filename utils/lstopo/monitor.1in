.SH PAPI MONITORING
In its graphical output, lstopo, jointly with PAPI is able to read hardware counters and agregate
 them on topology nodes. This option requires the file \fI/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid\fR
to be set to -1.
Each time interval, selected counters are read on each core. The difference between the old value 
and the new one is computed, then aggregated on selected nodes. If an arithmetic expression of 
counters is provided, the expression is evaluated on each sibling after aggregation.
.SH RECORD OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-perf\fR

Default perf option, will map random available counters on random nodes.
.TP
\fB\-\-perf\-output\fR \fIfile\fR

Print a trace of execution in a \fIfile\fR
.TP
\fB\-\-perf\-input\fR \fIfile\fR

Use a description \fIfile\fR as input to map counters on topology. The syntax must be as follow:

# a comment line

AN_identification_name0{OBJ=a_valid_hwloc_obj_name; CTR=an_arithmetic_expression_of_valid_PAPI_counters_name; MAX=a_real; MIN=a_real; LOGSCALE=an_integer}

my_counter{OBJ=L1i; CTR=PAPI_FP_OPS*PAPI_L1_ICM/100; MAX=0; MIN=0;}

The brackets must contain an object where to display the monitor, and an expression of counters. The other fields are optional.

#The parser skips new lines and spaces.
.TP
\fB\-\-perf\-no\-display\fR

If you want to avoid display overhead while recording counters you can use this option jointly with
\fB\-\-perf\-output\fR to keep an execution trace to display later.
.TP
\fB\-\-perf\-whole\-machine\fR

This option allows to record counters from each machine's processing unit, even if we should monitor a specific application or pid.
.TP
\fB\-\-perf\-accumulate\fR

This option will make counters accumulate along time instead of displaying difference between two contiguous time steps.
.TP
\fB\-\-perf\-output\fR to keep an execution trace to display later.
.TP
\fB\-\-refresh\fR \fIusec\fR

Time in usec between two hardware counters update.
.SH REPLAY OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-perf\-replay\fR \fIfile\fR

Replay an execution recorded with \fB\-\-perf\-output\fR \fIfile\fR option.
.TP
\fB\-\-perf\-replay\-phase\fR \fIphase_number\fR	
If you use the monitor lib to profile your code, you were able to set record phases, and
it is possible to replay a selected one.
.SH RECORDING AN APPLICATION
You can use monitoring features to display the machine state and restrict the display to one 
application execution.
.TP
\fB\-\-perf\-replay\-speed\fR \fIspeed_ratio\fR	
You can speed up or slowdown an execution replay with this option. Using a speed_ratio of 0.5
will speed up per 2 the execution time.
.SH RECORDING AN APPLICATION
You can use monitoring features to display the machine state and restrict the display to one 
application execution.

.TP
\fB\-\-pid\fR \fIpid\fR

This original lstopo option allows to attach to pid \fIpid\fR. Each time the counter will have to
be read, the library will look where \fIpid\fR tasks are currently running and operate only on
concerned counters. If a task is not in the state running, it will not be recorded. Consequently,
programs as sleep won't give any result.
.TP
You can start an application at the end of lstopo command line. In this case, the heavy library
stuff will be initialized before programms starts, then the programm will be started and recorded
according to its pid, the same way it is done with \fB\-\-pid\fR option.

lstopo --perf \fI<command>\fR
.TP
You can annotate your code with functions in \fImonitor.h\fR and link with \fI\-lmonitor \-hwloc \-lpapi\fR.
This way, a trace file will be created with counters updated as you wish, and recording phases 
defined the way you want to isolate parts of execution. Then you will be able to watch it with 
\fB\-\-perf\-replay\fR option once your programm exited.
