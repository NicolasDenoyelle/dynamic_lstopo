## hwloc fork with hierarchical performance monitoring
### Introduction

The Hardware Locality (hwloc) software project aims at easing the process of
discovering hardware resources in parallel architectures. It offers
command-line tools and a C API for consulting these resources, their locality,
attributes, and interconnection. hwloc primarily aims at helping
high-performance computing (HPC) applications, but is also applicable to any
project seeking to exploit code and/or data locality on modern computing
platforms.

This specific version contains a custom version of lstopo utility to display and/or record performance counters.
The counters collected with PAPI are summed into upper levels of the hierarchy to display live a consistent view of the machine state.

### Installation

Awaiting to be merged with the original project, this fork is hosted on github at 
```
https://github.com/NicolasDenoyelle/dynamic_lstopo
```

This version with performance monitoring has to be cloned from Git:
```
git clone https://github.com/NicolasDenoyelle/dynamic_lstopo.git
cd hwloc
./autogen.sh
```

Note that GNU Autoconf >=2.63, Automake >=1.11 and Libtool >=2.2.6, and recent version of PAPI are required
when building.

Installation by itself is the fairly common GNU-based process excepted that it requires to append the option `--enable-monitor` to the configure command line if you want to build the performance monitoring version:

```
./configure --prefix=... --enable-monitor
make
make install
```

Also note that if you install supplemental libraries in non-standard locations,
hwloc's configure script may not be able to find them without some help. You
may need to specify additional CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS, or PKG_CONFIG_PATH values on
the configure command line.

For example, if libpciaccess was installed into /opt/pciaccess, hwloc's
configure script may not find it be default. Try adding PKG_CONFIG_PATH to the
./configure command line, like this:

```
./configure PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/pciaccess/lib/pkgconfig ...
```

Running the "lstopo" tool is a good way to check as a graphical output whether
hwloc properly detected the architecture of your node. Netloc command-line
tools can be used to display the network topology interconnecting your nodes.


### Machine and applications monitoring

![Current machine state](https://github.com/NicolasDenoyelle/dynamic_lstopo/blob/monitor/E5-2650.png)

If monitoring is enabled during configuration, lstopo utility will use PAPI to Monitor an application or a machine into a graphical display.

#### Requirements

X output must be enabled.
You must ave permission to read every performance counters. It can be achieved by running the command: 
```
echo "-1" > /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid" as root.
```
PAPI, bison and lex must be installed.
If you use a custom installation of these, you have to append CPPFLAGS for includes and LDFLAGS for libraries to configure command line.

#### Usage
        
lstopo man page contains every extra perf option.
`lstopo --help` to. 

Use lstopo the same way as usual + append perf options:
`lstopo --perf` will display random availables counters on random topology nodes.
You can describe which counter(s) to display on a specific topology node in a file and give it to `lstopo` with the option `--perf-input`.
Performance input files syntax is the same as follow:

```
#commentary
#counter_name{
#  OBJ=hwloc_obj_name;                            #compulsory field
#  CTR=PAPI_COUNTER1*3.14159265359/PAPI_COUNTER2; #compulsory field
#  MAX=3.14159265;                                #optional field
#  MIN=0;                                         #optional field
#  LOGSCALE=1;                                    #optional field
#}
my_counter{OBJ=L1i; CTR=PAPI_FP_OPS*PAPI_L1_ICM/100;}
```

If an object or a counter isn't available on your system, a list of 
availables items will be dumped.

#### Monitoring an application

* As a backend:
```
lstopo <perf options> <your_application> <your application args>
```
Note: setting output to a pdf, a png, or a svg file will accumulate values and output them once, instead of classic graphic output where the display is refreshed periodically.


* Instrumenting your code:
Use `monitor.h` header in `<hwloc_install_include_dir>` and link your application  with `-lmonitor -lhwloc`
Once you executed your application, you can display the trace with `lstopo --perf-replay <output_file>`.

* Here is a minimal snippet example:
```
#include <monitor.h>
#include <hwloc.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

monitors_t monitor;

int main(void)
{
	/* Initialize monitors */
	monitors = load_Monitors_from_config(NULL, "my_perf_file", "my_output_file", 0);
	/* Attach to current pid */
	Monitors_watch_pid(monitors,getpid());

	/* start and collect current hardware counters' value */
	Monitors_start(monitors);

	/* Your code here */
	/* ... */

	/* update to current hardware counters' value */
	Monitors_update_counters(monitors);

	/* destroy monitors */
	delete_Monitors(monitors);
	return 0;
}
```

* Here is a snippet for sampling phases:

```
#include <pthread.h>
#include <monitor.h>
#include <hwloc.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <time.h>

monitors_t monitors;
pthread_t sampling_thr;	
pthread_mutex_t sample;
int end_flag = 0;

void take_a_sample(union sigval unused)
{
   pthread_mutex_unlock(&sample);
}

void * sampling_thread(void* refresh_usec)
{
   /* Init structure and timer for periodic samples */
   struct sigevent sevp;
   timer_t timerid;
   sevp.sigev_notify=SIGEV_THREAD;
   sevp.sigev_notify_function=take_a_sample;
   if(timer_create(CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID, &sevp, &timerid)==-1){
   	perror("timer_create");
	return NULL;
   }		
   struct itimerspec interval = {{0, 1000*(long)(intptr_t)(refresh_usec)}, {0, 0}} ;	

   /* Init mutex for sampling loop unlock every interval */
   pthread_mutex_init(&sample,NULL);
   pthread_mutex_lock(&sample);	

   /* trigger timer */
   timer_settime(timerid, 0, &interval, NULL);
   while(end_flag==0){
	pthread_mutex_lock(&sample);
	/* update to current hardware counters' value */
	Monitors_update_counters(monitors);
   }

   pthread_mutex_destroy(&sample);
   return NULL;
}

void sampling_start(long refresh_usec)
{
   sampling_thr = pthread_create(&sampling_thr,NULL,sampling_thread,NULL);
}

void sampling_stop(void)
{
   end_flag = 1;
   pthread_join(sampling_thr,NULL);
   end_flag = 0;
}

int main(void)
{
	/* Initialize monitors */
	monitors = load_Monitors_from_config(NULL, "my_performance_file", "my_output_file", 0);
	/* Attach to current pid */
	Monitors_watch_pid(monitors,getpid());
	/* start and collect current hardware counters' value */
	Monitors_start(monitors);
	/* Set a marker to find this phase into my_output_file */
	Monitors_set_phase(monitors, 0);
	/* Start sampling region every millisecond */
	sampling_start(1000);
	/* Your code here */
	/* ... */
	/* Stop sampling */
	sampling_stop();
	/* destroy monitors */
	delete_Monitors(monitors);
	return 0;
}
```
